-- Main Questions
	-- BEA: Do we use ACS or BEA Population to calculate Per Capita - Use ACS as Base, calculate the diff between ACS and BEA as a check
	-- MARPP: We need to create mappings to use State to backfill for Counties and CBSAs without RPP
		-- Let's create a Gold table that has these updated RPPs for Counties and CBSAs with the backfills from State
	-- MARPP: Do we use the Price Deflator for Real Incomes? 
		-- The suggestion is to use RPP All Items, then ingest CPI
	-- What year is Real GDP pegged at?
		-- BEA uses 2017 Chained Dollars - we should keep as is
	-- For Labor Force Participation we need the working age population, how do we define? 18-64? 16-64?
		-- Use 16+, we will need to refactor our Silver Layer to 16-17 separate from 15-17
	-- Do we have States or Counties missing from any of our tables?

-- Join Income to MARPP to get Real Income
	-- MARPP is only at CBSA and State
	-- For County, we should first mapp on CBSA, then go to CBSA
